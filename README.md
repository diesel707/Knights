# Knights and Knaves 
In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. 

Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false. 

The objective of the algorithm is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave. 

The algorithm uses the propositional logic to solve the puzzle.

# Nim Game

In the Nim game, we begin with some number of piles, each with some number of objects. 

Players take turns: on a playerâ€™s turn, the player removes any non-negative number of objects from any one non-empty pile. 

Whoever removes the last object loses. 

For the game, I had used Q-learning.

Programming Language: Python

Tool: IDLE framework

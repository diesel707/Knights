# Minesweeper Game using Artificial Intelligence

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” 

Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. 

Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells, where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine. 

The algorithm will solve the whole minesweeper game. 

The algorithm uses the propositional logic to solve the game.
